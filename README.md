# PlatinumBot
The open-source Discord Bot, ready to join and help you and your admin's protect, entertain and serve your server members and community.

### What is PlatinumBot?
PlatinumBot is a simply made Discord bot based and built using Python. It's overall objective is to eliminate the need for the various circulating Discord Bots, and create an all-in-one solution making server management and controlling your server environment easier than ever.

### How can I use PlatinumBot in my server?
As of now, PlatinumBot is currently in the BETA testing stage of development. Despite this, to add PlatinumBot to your server, we currently have two options in order to use this bot.

1. Host your bot yourself (Self-Host)
With this option, you give yourself the oppurtunity to modify the PlatinumBot's base code and add and remove features and text as you wish!

- Congrats! You're almost there.
- To use this bot on your own PC or server environment, you'll need the following to setup.
  - Make sure you have the latest version of Discord on your client system and Python installed on the bot's environment.
  - Go to Discord.com and scroll to the bottom and select Developers
  - Login using the account that will be adding the bot to the account
  - Create a new application to host your bot
  - ...
  - ...
  - Using your favourite text editor of choice, open the base file and change the values for CLIENT_ID and TOKEN to the values found on your Developers Panel
  - Run your bot and using the invite link template, create a link and use it to select your server.
  - That's it! Now you can run the bot and test it out.

### Why is PlatinumBot Open Source?
We believe that one of the most important things of any project is the ability to make changes to alter anything that you wish, without the difficulty of decompiling and the difficulty of understanding someone else's code or thought process. We encourage you to look over the code for PlatinumBot and feel free to change the code and explore new and creative ways to make it better and fit your needs. 

### I need support with my bot configuration and/or setup. What can I do?
