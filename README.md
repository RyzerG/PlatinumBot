# PlatinumBot
The open-source Discord Bot, ready to join and help you and your admin's protect, entertain and serve your server members and community.

### What is PlatinumBot?
PlatinumBot is a simply made Discord bot based and built using Python. It's overall objective is to eliminate the need for the various circulating Discord Bots, and create an all-in-one solution making server management and controlling your server environment easier than ever.

### How can I use PlatinumBot in my server?
As of now, PlatinumBot is currently in the BETA testing stage of development. Despite this, to add PlatinumBot to your server, we currently have two options in order to use this bot.

1. Host your bot yourself (Self-Host)
With this option, you give yourself the oppurtunity to modify the PlatinumBot's base code and add and remove features and text as you wish!
